# oxideav-vfw

Pure-Rust 32-bit x86 emulator + PE loader + Video for Windows host
that lets [oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-workspace)
delegate decoding (and eventually encoding) to legitimately-licensed
Windows codec DLLs on **any** platform — Linux, macOS, FreeBSD,
Windows itself. The codec never executes on the host CPU; it runs
through a software-interpreter sandbox.

## Status

**Round 1 — "Load + DllMain + clean exit" landed.** The full
design contract is the 659-line document at
[`OxideAV/docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md`](https://github.com/OxideAV/docs/blob/master/winmf/winmf-emulator.md).

This round delivers:

* `emulator::mmu` — flat 4 GiB R/W/X-permissioned MMU with
  sparse 4 KiB pages.
* `emulator::regs` + `emulator::decode` + `emulator::isa_int`
  — i386 integer ISA interpreter (CPUID returns canned
  Pentium-class response; privileged + far calls + segment
  loads trap; MMX deferred to round 2).
* `pe` — PE32 loader: DOS + PE header parse, section mapping,
  base relocation, IAT resolution, export-by-name. Rejects
  PE32+ / .NET / packed binaries.
* `win32::kernel32` — 12 stubs (heap + atomics +
  OutputDebugStringA + GetTickCount + LoadLibraryA +
  GetProcAddress).
* `runtime::Sandbox` — public entry point: load a DLL, call
  `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)`, return cleanly.

Round 2 will add: MMX ISA + the `vfw32` stubs (`ICOpen` /
`ICDecompress*` / `ICClose` / `ICGetInfo`) + cdecl plumbing,
and a "decode one Cinepak frame" end-to-end test.

## Why this exists

The crate has **two co-equal end-uses**:

### 1. Rare-codec compatibility

Run codecs the project would otherwise permanently shelve.
Modern codecs (H.264, HEVC, AV1, VP9, Opus, AAC, …) have
pure-Rust decoders elsewhere in the oxideav workspace, but some
old codecs were never published with a public spec and never had
a clean-room reverse-engineering writeup defensible enough for
the project's standard:

* Indeo 4 / Indeo 5 (Intel)
* Sorenson Video 1 / 3
* MS-MPEG-4 v1 / v2 / v3 (DivX-:-) era)
* On2 VP3-pre-Theora variants, VP4, VP5
* Cook (RealAudio)
* Various Microsoft speech codecs (ACELP, GSM 6.10 MS variant,
  TrueSpeech, Voxware, Lernout-and-Hauspie, …)
* DivX 3/4/5 early versions
* 3ivx and other early MPEG-4 variants

For these formats, the original Win32 codec DLLs are
legitimately redistributable (shipped in K-Lite codec packs, in
Microsoft Windows Media Player redistributables, in QuickTime
installers, in old Linux `vfw_codecs` packages). The bridge says
"we don't decode them ourselves; we delegate to the user's
licensed codec running in our sandbox".

### 2. Reverse-engineering aid

Once a codec runs in the sandbox, the same emulator becomes a
clean-room **research instrument**: every guest memory access,
every Win32 stub call, and (optionally) every guest instruction
crosses a Rust boundary, so the emulator can faithfully record
what the codec is doing on a target bitstream. Output is JSONL
events; downstream tooling (Python/jq) post-processes them into
the kind of behavioural traces the workspace's
specifier→extractor→implementer round procedure consumes when
producing clean-room codec specs from scratch.

This is gated behind the `trace` Cargo feature (off by default
because it adds branches on emulator hot paths). See the
**Trace mode** section of `docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md` for the
event schema and the programmatic API
(`Sandbox::watch(addr, size, mode)` /
`Sandbox::set_trace_sink(...)`). Lands post-round-5 — the
infrastructure is documented today so that round-5+ work
designs around it rather than retrofits.

The two end-uses share the same compatibility-track machinery
(MMU, ISA interpreter, PE loader, Win32 stubs) — the
research-track is a layered set of probes on top, not a fork.

## How

Four layers, all pure Rust, all aimed at
`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`:

1. **Emulator** — flat 4 GiB virtual MMU, i386 integer +
   eventually MMX, page-grained R/W/X permissions, every memory
   access bounds-checked. No JIT, no host-CPU dependence.
2. **PE loader** — maps a PE32 DLL into emulator memory, applies
   base relocations, resolves the import address table against
   our Win32 stub surface, finds the entry point, calls
   `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)`.
3. **Win32 stubs** — Rust functions exposed to the loaded DLL
   through the IAT. `kernel32` essentials (heap, atomics, TLS),
   `vfw32` for `ICDecompress*` dispatch, `msacm32` for the
   audio milestone. DirectShow / DMO / Media Foundation are
   later milestones if a target codec demands them.
4. **Codec wrapper** — `Box<dyn Decoder>` / `Box<dyn Encoder>`
   that drives the VfW `DriverProc` message dispatch and
   marshals data buffers across the sandbox boundary.

Performance: ~50–200 M instructions/sec interpreter throughput
on a modern CPU, which gives 10–40× realtime for
Cinepak-shaped codecs and 1.5–7× realtime for MS-MPEG-4 family.
Modern codecs (WMV9, H.264) would not be realtime in the
interpreter; that's why this crate is scoped to legacy / rare
codecs only. JIT is a future optimisation.

## Reading order

1. **`docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md` §Goals and non-goals** —
   what this crate is and is not for.
2. **`docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md` §Provenance and allowed
   references** — the IP discipline. Microsoft PE/COFF spec +
   MSDN + Intel x86 manual are allowed; Wine, Bochs, QEMU,
   ReactOS are forbidden.
3. **`docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md` §Architectural overview**
   — the four layers and their responsibilities.
4. **`docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md` §Milestones** — what
   round-1 ships, what later rounds add.
5. **`docs/winmf/winmf-emulator.md` §Safety boundary** — why
   the codec is fundamentally safer to run through this
   crate than any native-execution alternative.

## Cargo features

* **`registry`** (default): wire the crate into `oxideav-core`'s
  codec registry. Disable for standalone builds (`oxideav-vfw =
  { default-features = false }`) that just want the emulator
  + PE loader + Win32 host as a library, without the framework
  integration.
